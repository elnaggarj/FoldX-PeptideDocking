# FoldX-PeptideDocking
Python scripts to model peptide docking using FoldX Suite

repariPDBs.py - repair the list of PDBs to be used in downstream FoldX tools

foldx_covmutation.py - peptide docking script. Current script converts the PDB to bind a desired peptide, then mutating that peptide to calculate change in binding affinity
